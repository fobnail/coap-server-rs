# An(other) Async Rust CoAP server

An asynchronous [CoAP](https://coap.technology/) server with a modern and
ergonomic API for larger scale applications, inspired by warp and actix.

* **Ergonomic**: Fluent app-builder API makes it easy to compose rich
  applications, including those that use more advanced CoAP features.
* **Concurrent**: High concurrency is supported by using a separate spawned
  task for each request, allowing long running requests to not interfere with
  shorter running ones at scale.
* **Feature-rich**: Supports a wide range of CoAP server features including
  [Observe](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7641), and [Block-wise
  Transfer](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7959).
* **Flexible**: Supports pluggable transport backends with goals of supporting
  alternative async runtimes like
  [embassy](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy).
